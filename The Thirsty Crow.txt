After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow was wandering the forest
in search of water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He
tried to drink from it but his beak wasn't long enough to reach the
water inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground and one by one, he
put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then
hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.
