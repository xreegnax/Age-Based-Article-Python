There was a boy named John who was so lazy,
he couldn't even bother to change his clothes.
One day, he saw that the apple tree in their yard
was full of fruits. He wanted to eat some apples
but he was too lazy to climb the tree and take the fruits.
So he lay down underneath the tree and waited for the fruits
to fall off. John waited and waited until he was very hungry
but the apples never fell.
