"Tell me, where do ghosts in love
Find their bridal veils?"

"If you and I were ghosts in love
We'd climb the cliffs of Mystery,
Above the sea of Wails.

I'd trim your gray and streaming hair
With veils of Fantasy
From the tree of Memory.

'Tis there the ghosts that fall in love
Find their bridal veils."
