Once there was a hungry fox who stumbled upon a vineyard.
After seeing the round, juicy grapes hanging in a bunch,
the fox drooled. But no matter how high he jumped, he
couldn't reach for it. So he told himself that it was
probably sour and left. That night, he had to sleep on an
empty stomach.
